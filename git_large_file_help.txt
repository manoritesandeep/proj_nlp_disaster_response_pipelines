To remove the large file from your Git history while keeping the other files committed, you can follow these steps:

    Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your project.

    Run the following command to rewrite your Git history and remove the large file:

    git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f try3/rfc_model_try3.pkl' --prune-empty HEAD
    {to force if rewriting} 
    git filter-branch -f --tree-filter 'rm -f model_pkl_files/final1.zip' --prune-empty HEAD

    This command will remove the try3/rfc_model_try3.pkl file from all commits in your Git history.

    After running the command, Git will rewrite your history. This process may take some time, depending on the size of your repository and the number of commits.

    Once the history has been rewritten, you can force-push the changes to your GitHub repository using the following command:

    git push -f origin master

    Please note that force-pushing will overwrite the remote repository with your local changes. Make sure you have a backup of your repository or any important changes before proceeding.

By following these steps, you should be able to remove the large file from your Git history and push the other files to your GitHub repository. 


To confirm whether the large file was successfully removed, you can check the commit history using the following command:

git log --oneline --name-status
